Start a daily planning update. This should be quick (2-5 minutes).

First, read current state:
1. Search work-planning memory context for recent tasks and the current week's plan
2. Use Google Calendar MCP to get today's schedule from all calendars
3. Use Gmail MCP to check for any new Ambient emails since yesterday (new meeting action items)

Report briefly:
- What's on the calendar for today
- Any new action items from yesterday's meetings
- What was planned vs. what's actually scheduled

Ask the user:
- What changed since yesterday?
- Did anything take longer/shorter than expected?
- Any new urgent items?

Then:
- Adjust calendar blocks on "Working Time" as needed (move, resize, create new)
- Update work-planning memory with any changes
- If tasks were completed, note actual_time vs. estimated_time (this feeds the learning loop)
- Flag anything that won't fit this week

Keep it lightweight - this is a quick check-in, not a full replanning session.
